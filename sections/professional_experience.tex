    \textbf{Data Scientist} | \textit{Exiger} | \textit{McLean, VA}\hfill August 2024 - Present\\
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12pt]
        \itemsep -4pt {} \vspace{-1.4em}
        \item Implement advanced scripts to parse PDF files of PowerPoint presentations, utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and integrating ChatGPT for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract relationships and identify associated risks. This solution enables seamless data integration and standardization across multiple datasets, improving the accuracy and consistency of risk assessments.
        \item Design, create, and oversee Python scripts that automate the generation of reports used by hundreds of researchers. These automation tools enhance the efficiency and speed of report creation by over 5 days, reducing manual effort and allowing researchers to concentrate on analysis rather than report preparation.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Data Science Intern} | \textit{Exiger} | \textit{McLean, VA} \hfill May 2024 - August 2024\\
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12pt]
        \itemsep -4pt {} \vspace{-1.4em}
        \item Developed and enacted sophisticated algorithms to parse prefixes and suffixes from a dataset of over 2 million companies. Integrated Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction and applied both language detection and character type detection to accurately process and standardize multilingual company data, significantly enhancing data quality and analysis.
        \item Engineered a robust geocoding and address parsing system that processed complex address data, converting raw inputs into standardized formats and precise geographical coordinates. This system empowered more accurate location-based analysis and informed strategic decision-making.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12pt]
        \itemsep -4pt {} \vspace{-1.4em}
        \item Leveraged Selenium and BeautifulSoup in Python to scrape over 1 million Twitter interactions among RePEc users, analyzing social media dynamics in the academic community.
        \item Designed a scalable relational database schema to manage large datasets, ensuring data integrity and enabling comprehensive trend analysis.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \textbf{Software Engineer Intern} | \textit{AECOM} | \textit{Germantown, MD} \hfill May 2023 - December 2023\\
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12pt]
        \itemsep -4pt {} \vspace{-1.4em}
        \item Created and deployed Python scripts for the automated ingestion of dense accelerometer data into a PostgreSQL timeseries database, leveraging AWS Lambda functions to reduce data processing time by 70 percent.
        \item Built a full-stack alert system for AWS and Azure infrastructures, utilizing Angular and Grafana for real-time data visualization, enabling proactive monitoring of cloud services.
    \end{itemize}
